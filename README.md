# Multi-view Datasets for clustering or classificaiton

Some Multi-view benchmark datases

They are provided at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1UoWwBz9sgvzJAL65lLZR7A, the code is i7b3.

# Brief description
AwA consists of  30,475 images of 50 animals classes. Six views contains six officially provided features. https://cvml.ist.ac.at/AwA/

COIL100 collects 7,200 images of 100 categories. Three heterogeneous features, i.e., isometric projection (ISO), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE), are used as multiple views. http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php

MNIST2 contains 60,000 digit number images from "0" to "9", which are formed as three heterogeneous views, including ISO, LDA, and NPE. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

NUSWIDEOBJ collects 30,000 images of 31 classes. Each class has 11 images, which are described as 5 views, including Color Histogram, block-wise Color Moments , Color Correlogram, Edge Direction Histogram, and Wavelet Texture. https://lms.comp.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/

PIE comes from the CMU multi-PIE face database. We extract the $32\times 32$ images of individuals from C07, C09, and C29 to build the three-view dataset. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/PIE/

YoutubeFaces consists of 101,499 faces video obtained from Youtube. https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/
